# Decision Transformer

This codebase is an adaptation of the coded official codebase for [Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/decision-transformer) that can be found [here](https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer).

## Overview

The purpose of this code is to use the Decision Transformer architectures for learning on a different kind of environment, in particular the model solved the [Lunar Lander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) game.
